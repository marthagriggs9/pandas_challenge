## PyCity Schools

### Summary

The following data contains math and reading standardized test scores for various schools in the PyCity School District. The data also contains other important information in regardsto each school, such as school budget and type (Charter or District).    
This data has been sorted by various metrics to more easily find trends in school performance. These findings can help PyCity make more informed decisions about school budget allocations. 

### Analysis Findings

* Despite having two of the top three total budgets in the district, Hernandez High School ($3,022,020) and Johnson High School ($3,094,650) had overall passing rates (students that passed both math and reading with a score of 70 or higher) of just over 50% (53.52 and 53.53 respectively). While able to spend more money per student, these schools were in the bottom five schools in regards to overall passing rates. 

* When analyzing the data comparing the spending per student to the overall passing rate, shcools that spent less than $585 per student had higher overall passing rates compared to schools with the highest per student spending range of $645-$680. 

* Small (<1000 students) and Medium (1000-2000 students) sized schools had higher overall passing percentages, as well as extremely high passing percentages in reading, compared to the larger (2000-5000 students) schools. This could be due to small and medium sized schools being able to offer smaller student to teacher ratios that allow for more individualized instruction. This could also explain the extremely high passing rate in reading; teacher may be able to tailor reading instruction and strategies to individual students, increasing their success in reading. 

* The data also revealed that all top five schools (in regards to overall passing rate) were Charter schools. These schools also fell in the Small and Medium sized school range, which could be impacting student performance and succes. All the District school included in the data were Large and none made it into the top half of Overall Passing Percentages. In fact, there was a 34.58% difference between the lowest performing Charter school and the top performing District school, when comparing Overall Passing Percentage.  
More information would be needed to determine what possible differences the Charter schools in PyCity have compared to District schools besides lower student spending and total student population.
